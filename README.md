# pythonhello
gettin goin with python
already on my way in JavaScript,
I think it will be beneficial to start learning Python
This first project is all about just getting stuff
installed and running properly through vscode.
Not planning to put a plethora of python pages in this particular folder.
Also, at the moment I could be better with the desktop git fiddle app,
so I plan to revision control some of my experiments in python
Hence, this repository of noobness
